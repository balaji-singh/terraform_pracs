To synchronize an on-premises OpenLDAP server with a cloud-based OpenLDAP server, you can use LDAP Sync replication, 
which is a standard LDAP protocol extension that allows you to replicate data between two LDAP servers. 
Here is a high-level overview of the steps you can follow to set up LDAP Sync replication:

Install the necessary software on both the on-premises and cloud-based LDAP servers. 
This will typically include the OpenLDAP software itself and any additional tools or libraries needed for LDAP Sync replication.

Configure the on-premises LDAP server as the "master" server and the cloud-based LDAP server as the "slave" server. 
This involves setting up the necessary replication agreements and access controls on both servers.

Initialize the replication process by manually exporting the data from the on-premises LDAP server and importing it into the cloud-based LDAP server. 
This can be done using tools such as ldapsearch and ldapadd.

Set up a cron job or other automated process to regularly synchronize the data between the two servers. 
This can be done using a script or utility such as ldapmodify or ldapsync.

Monitor the replication process and troubleshoot any issues that may arise. This may involve checking log files, 
running diagnostic tests, and making configuration changes as needed.

It's worth noting that setting up LDAP Sync replication can be a complex process and may require a certain level of expertise with LDAP and Linux.
If you are not familiar with these technologies, it may be helpful to seek the assistance of a knowledgeable IT professional or refer to relevant documentation and online resources for guidance.
