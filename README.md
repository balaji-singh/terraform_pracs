In this structure, the accounts folder contains a subfolder for each account, and each account folder contains a subfolder for each stage (e.g. dev, stage, prod). The modules folder contains your Terraform modules, which can be shared across multiple accounts and stages.

To use this structure, you can create a separate Terragrunt configuration file for each account and stage, and use Terragrunt's terraform block to specify the path to the appropriate Terraform code and modules. For example:

.

│ │ │ ├── staging
│ │ │ └── prod
│ │ └── modules

In this structure, the accounts directory contains a subdirectory for each AWS account that you are managing with Terraform. Each account directory has its own environments and modules directories, which contain the Terraform code for the various environments (e.g. dev, staging, prod) and reusable modules in that account.

The global directory contains code that is shared across all accounts, such as global infrastructure resources or cross-account IAM policies. It also has its own environments and modules directories.

You can then use Terragrunt to manage the configuration and execution of the Terraform code in each of the environment directories. For example, you could use variable overrides and input variables to customize the behavior of the modules for each environment.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.

The .github directory contains the configuration for the GitHub Actions workflow that is responsible for deploying and managing the infrastructure in the various accounts and regions. It has a workflows subdirectory that contains a separate workflow file for each account (e.g. account-1.yml, account-2.yml, etc.).

You can then use the env block in the workflow files to set up environment variables for each account and region, and use Terragrunt to pass these variables as input variables to the Terraform code. This will allow you to customize the behavior of the modules for each account and region without having to maintain separate copies of the code.

The Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (EKS) is a managed service that makes it easy to deploy and run Kubernetes on AWS. Calico is an open-source networking and network security solution for containers, VMs, and bare metal hosts.

You can use Terraform to create an EKS cluster with Calico as the network provider by using the following steps:

Install and configure the AWS provider for Terraform. You will need to provide your AWS access keys and region in order to use the provider.

Create a Terraform module that defines the EKS cluster and the Calico configuration. The module should include the following resources:

aws_eks_cluster: This resource creates an EKS cluster.
aws_eks_cluster_auth: This resource creates an IAM role and policy that allows the EKS worker nodes to join the cluster.
aws_iam_role_policy_attachment: This resource attaches the IAM policy to the IAM role.
aws_eks_node_group: This resource creates an EKS worker node group.
aws_launch_configuration: This resource creates a launch configuration for the worker nodes.
aws_autoscaling_group: This resource creates an Auto Scaling group for the worker nodes.
aws_iam_instance_profile: This resource creates an IAM instance profile for the worker nodes.
aws_route53_record: This resource creates a DNS record for the EKS cluster.
aws_security_group: This resource creates a security group for the worker nodes.
In the module, use the aws_eks_cluster resource to create the EKS cluster, and specify the kubernetes_version and role_arn arguments.

Use the aws_eks_cluster_auth resource to create the IAM role and policy that allows the worker nodes to join the cluster.

Use the aws_iam_role_policy_attachment resource to attach the IAM policy to the IAM role.

Use the aws_eks_node_group resource to create the EKS worker node group, and specify the cluster_name, node_group_name, and scaling_config arguments.

Use the aws_launch_configuration resource to create a launch configuration for the worker nodes, and specify the image_id, instance_type, and security_groups arguments.

Use the aws_autoscaling_group resource to create an Auto Scaling group for the worker nodes, and specify the launch_configuration, min_size, and max_size arguments.

Use the aws_iam_instance_profile resource to create an IAM instance profile for the worker nodes.

Use the aws_route53_record resource to create a DNS record for the EKS cluster.

Use the aws_security_group resource to create a security group for the worker nodes, and specify the vpc_id and ingress arguments.

You can then use the Terraform module to create the EKS cluster with Calico as the network provider by calling the module in your Terraform configuration and providing the necessary input variables.

Prometheus federation is a feature that allows you to merge data from multiple Prometheus servers into a single view. This can be useful in scenarios where you have multiple Prometheus instances running in different environments or clusters, and you want to have a unified view of all the metrics.

To set up federation in Prometheus, you need to configure the target Prometheus servers as upstreams in the Prometheus configuration file. You can then use the /federate API endpoint to query the metrics from the upstream servers.

Here is an example of how you can configure federation in Prometheus:

Copy code
global:
scrape_interval: 15s # By default, scrape targets every 15 seconds.
evaluation_interval: 15s # By default, scrape targets every 15 seconds.

# A scrape configuration containing exactly one endpoint to scrape:

# Here it's Prometheus itself.

scrape_configs:

# The job name is added as a label `job=<job_name>` to any timeseries scraped from this config.

- job_name: 'prometheus'
  # Override the global default and scrape targets from this job every 5 seconds.
  scrape_interval: 5s
  static_configs:
  - targets: ['localhost:9090']

# Add a scrape configuration for the federated Prometheus servers.

- job_name: 'federated'
  scrape_interval: 5s
  honor_labels: true
  metrics_path: '/federate'
  params:
  'match[]': - '{job="prometheus"}'
  static_configs: - targets: - 'prometheus-1:9090' - 'prometheus-2:9090' - 'prometheus-3:9090'
  In this example, we have defined a scrape configuration for the federated Prometheus servers with the job name federated. The /federate API endpoint is used to query the metrics from the upstream servers, and the match[] parameter is used to specify the metrics to be queried.

Once you have set up federation in Prometheus, you can use the /federate API endpoint to query the metrics from the upstream servers. For example, to query the up metric from all the upstream servers, you can use the following query:

Copy code
/federate?match[]={job="prometheus"}&time=15m
You can also use the sum or avg functions to aggregate the metrics across the upstream servers.

Copy code
/federate?match[]={job="prometheus"}&time=15m&aggregate_function=sum

Prometheus federation allows you to gather metrics from multiple Prometheus servers into a single view. This can be useful when you have multiple Prometheus instances running in different environments, such as different clusters or regions, and you want to be able to see the metrics from all of these instances in a single place.

To set up federation, you need to configure each Prometheus server to send its metrics to a central server. You can do this by adding a remote_write section to the Prometheus configuration file and specifying the URL of the central server.

Here is an example of how you can set up federation using the remote_write configuration:

Copy code
remote_write:

- url: "http://central-server:9091/api/v1/write"
  basic_auth:
  username: username
  password: password
  On the central server, you need to configure a remote_read section to receive the metrics from the other Prometheus servers. This can be done by adding the following configuration to the Prometheus configuration file:

Copy code
remote_read:

- url: "http://prometheus-server-1:9090/api/v1/read"
  basic_auth:
  username: username
  password: password
- url: "http://prometheus-server-2:9090/api/v1/read"
  basic_auth:
  username: username
  password: password
  Once the federation is set up, the central server will periodically scrape the metrics from the other Prometheus servers and store them in its own storage. You can then use a tool such as Grafana to visualize the metrics from all of the Prometheus servers in a single dashboard.

It's important to note that federation is not a replacement for proper monitoring and alerting setup. It's intended to be used as an additional tool to provide a global view of the metrics.

Prometheus federation allows you to federate data from multiple Prometheus servers into a single view. This can be useful in scenarios where you have multiple independent Prometheus deployments that you want to monitor and query together.

To set up federation in Prometheus, you need to configure the following:

A Prometheus server that will act as the federation "parent" and will scrape data from the other Prometheus servers (the "children").

One or more Prometheus servers that will be scraped by the parent server.

To configure federation in the parent Prometheus server, you need to add a federate rule in the scrape_configs section of the configuration file. The federate rule specifies the targets to be scraped and the scraping interval.

Here is an example of how you can set up federation in the parent Prometheus server:

Copy code
scrape_configs:

- job_name: 'federate'
  honor_labels: true
  metrics_path: '/federate'
  params:
  'match[]': - '{job="prometheus"}'
  static_configs: - targets: - 'child-prometheus-1:9090' - 'child-prometheus-2:9090'
  relabel_configs: - source_labels: [__name__]
  target_label: **name**
  replacement: ${1} - source_labels: [__path__]
  target_label: **metrics_path**
  replacement: /api/v1/query - source_labels: [job]
  target_label: job
  replacement: prometheus
  scrape_interval: 15s
  In this example, the parent Prometheus server will scrape metrics from child-prometheus-1 and child-prometheus-2 every 15 seconds, and will label the metrics with the job label set to prometheus.

To configure the children Prometheus servers, you need to add a remote_write configuration in the remote_write section of the configuration file. The remote_write configuration specifies the parent Prometheus server to which the metrics should be sent.

Here is an example of how you can set up federation in the child Prometheus servers:

Copy code
remote_write:

- url: 'http://parent-prometheus:9090/api/v1/write'
  In this example, the child Prometheus servers will send their metrics to the parent Prometheus server at http://parent-prometheus:9090/api/v1/write.

Once the federation is set up, you can use the parent Prometheus server to query and visualize the metrics from all the child Prometheus servers.
